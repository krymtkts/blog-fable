# Sample page without front matter

The page can omit front matter `title`, `date` and `tags`.

For pages without a specified `date`, set the build date as the publication date of the RSS feed.

Recommend specifying the `title` in front matter.

If a page does not have a `title`, the generated link will look like this.
