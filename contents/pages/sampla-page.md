Posts have front matter.
The front matter feature is same as post's one.

The front matter for this post is as follows.

```yaml

title: Sample page with front matter
tags: [sample, yaml]

```

You can define a page without front matter if you want.

See [sample-page-without-front-matter.md](http://localhost:8080/blog-fable/pages/sampla-page-without-front-matter.html)
