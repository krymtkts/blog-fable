Posts have front matter.
The front matter feature is same as post's one.

The front matter for this post is as follows.

```yaml
---
title: Sample page `code sample`
tags: [sample, yaml]
date: 2023-09-01
---
```

You can define a page without front matter if you want.

See [sample-page-without-front-matter.md](/blog-fable/pages/sampla-page-without-front-matter.html)
