# Fable Static Site Generator

This is a small Fable app project to generate static pages.
Use React with [Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/#/).

This repository re-creates a subset of [fable-compiler/static-web-generator](https://github.com/fable-compiler/static-web-generator) with the latest dependencies.

## Motivation

- Learn how to write app with Fable
- Rebuild [My personal blog](https://github.com/krymtkts/krymtkts.github.io) with F#

## Building and running the app

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Build pages: `npm run build`
- Build pages and start a development server: `npm run start`
  - After finished the first compilation, open: `http://localhost:8080/`
